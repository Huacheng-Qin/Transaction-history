# Transaction-history
The program reads in data stored in a text file (in a specific format), then processes the information and stores it in a linked list.
After the text file is empty the program sorts the information and prints the data to the console.

Note: the parts marked with "TASK" are created by me while the parts marked "GIVEN" were... given.
